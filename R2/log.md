## Log

### R2D1 - November 19, Saturday, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Got started with a simple Articles API and defined the openapi spec for the APIs I want to implement for Articles.

**Thoughts:** Currently, focusing on only creating a barebones API through TDD with no user Auth or any User related concept. Planning to extend/rewrite major parts of the same to implement the Authn/Authz in this project.

**Link to work:** Here's the repo for the work: [mehrankamal/articles-api](https://github.com/mehrankamal/articles-api)

### R2D2 - November 20, Saturday, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Got golang and haskell installation automated through Ansible. This step was part of my provision automation plan.

**Thoughts:** The progress is still kinda slow, but I believe it is the part to starting to work with new things and understand the best choices until it becomes an habit to do so.

**Link to work:** Here's my `provision` repo which contains a readme of achieved automation and those which are done: [mehrankamal/provision](https://github.com/mehrankamal/provision)
