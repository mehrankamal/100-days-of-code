## Log

### R1D0 - August 13, Friday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** It's day 0. So, I planned the things I am going to be doing next 100 days.

**Thoughts:** I am planning on getting my hands dirty with backend systems and Machine Learning. I will be following the [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) and some other online courses for Machine Learning, and [Go in Practice](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-practice) and other resources for backend part. I will also be brushing up on Data Structures and Algorithms and solving problems on platform such as Codeforces, CodeChef, and CSES pSet.

### R1D1 - August 14, Saturday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Solved problems [Counting Rooms](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1192) and [Labyrinth](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1193) which were graph problems, easily solvable using BFS and DFS. Started ```Hands-On ML``` book chapter 1 and read till Page 17.

**Thoughts:** I spent 2 hours today. Learned about the of machine learning landscape that we have Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement and Semi learning environments. How the offline and online training can be applicable to some tasks and just the lifecycle of an ML Project. In Competitive Programming, I revised Graph algorithms and solved problems to get going.

### R1D3 - August 16, Monday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Wrote the data exploration notebook for the new Kaggle's Competition: [Google Landmark Recognition 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-2021).

**Thoughts:** The data will need some augmentation techniques for class imbalance and also for getting the resolution upto a reasonable one. The dataset is really big with "1580470" image samples and around 203k landscapes to identify. Hope to learn something new and good. :v:

### R1D16 - August 29, Sunday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Explored `neovim` editor and learned how to make a good `.vimrc`.

**Thoughts:** VIM as an editor is one of the most minimal and customizable. Using it in the beginning maybe somewhat confusing but it is totally worth it.

**Link to work:** Checkout my [init.nvim](https://gist.github.com/mehrankamal/8c125c02f69cb51ae499eee68c3c2737). It is kind of spagettgi for now but I am planning to make a `dotfiles` repo with scripts and all the workflow options with a tutorial for beginners like me.

**Thoughts:** Getting a grip on graphs. Will be moving to some other topic for now.

**Link to work:** Checkout the last 2 problems in the [mehrankamal/competitive-100](https://github.com/mehrankamal/competitive-100) repo, according to commit [here](https://github.com/mehrankamal/competitive-100/commit/4320eb9290294b08a5f22b7df326ea7fb6cc95bb).

### R1D18 - August 31, Tuesday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finally, got started with a go project.

**Thoughts:** The project is quite simple one that will be get going with TDD and writing webservers. A simple CRUD application for notes. The final project will feature User authentication and notes related to those users.

**Link to work:** Checkout the [mehrankamal/noter](https://github.com/mehrankamal/noter) repo.

### R1D20 - September 2, Thursday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Introduced the store interface in the project, and wrote and refactored tests for asserting http status codes.

**Thoughts:** The TDD seems kind of dumb because you are writing minimal code to pass the tests and refactor code but it is said to be a good practice to introducing good code and drive good design.

**Link to work:** Checkout the [mehrankamal/noter](https://github.com/mehrankamal/noter) repo. Checkout [Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) for TDD in Golang.

### R1D23 - September 5, Saturday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Learned contexts, and circuit breaker & Debounce patterns.

**Thoughts:** The Contexts are used to provide request-scoped cancellation signals and timeouts. The Circuit Breaker pattern allows for dealing with cascading failures and Debounce helps with ratelimiting for function calls.
