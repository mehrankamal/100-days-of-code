### R1D0 - August 13, Monday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** It's day 0. So, I planned the things I am going to be doing next 100 days.

**Thoughts:** I am planning on getting my hands dirty with backend systems and Machine Learning. I will be following the [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) and some other online courses for Machine Learning, and [Go in Practice](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-practice) and other resources for backend part. I will also be brushing up on Data Structures and Algorithms and solving problems on platform such as Codeforces, CodeChef, and CSES pSet.
