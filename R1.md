Missed day(s) count = 1

### Updates

- Will not be following [Go in Practice](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-practice), instead will be following [Cloud Native Go: Building Reliable Services in Unreliable Environments](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-go/9781492076322/) for the backend part.

## Log

### R1D0 - August 13, Friday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** It's day 0. So, I planned the things I am going to be doing next 100 days.

**Thoughts:** I am planning on getting my hands dirty with backend systems and Machine Learning. I will be following the [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) and some other online courses for Machine Learning, and [Go in Practice](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-practice) and other resources for backend part. I will also be brushing up on Data Structures and Algorithms and solving problems on platform such as Codeforces, CodeChef, and CSES pSet.

### R1D1 - August 14, Saturday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Solved problems [Counting Rooms](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1192) and [Labyrinth](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1193) which were graph problems, easily solvable using BFS and DFS. Started ```Hands-On ML``` book chapter 1 and read till Page 17.

**Thoughts:** I spent 2 hours today. Learned about the of machine learning landscape that we have Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement and Semi learning environments. How the offline and online training can be applicable to some tasks and just the lifecycle of an ML Project. In Competitive Programming, I revised Graph algorithms and solved problems to get going.

### R1D3 - August 16, Monday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Wrote the data exploration notebook for the new Kaggle's Competition: [Google Landmark Recognition 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-2021).

**Thoughts:** The data will need some augmentation techniques for class imbalance and also for getting the resolution upto a reasonable one. The dataset is really big with "1580470" image samples and around 203k landscapes to identify. Hope to learn something new and good. :v:

### R1D4 - August 17, Tuesday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Solved sorting and searching problems on CSES Problem Set and saw others solutions for the same.

**Thoughts:** There is need of more practice and also review of C++ STL basics.

**Link to work:** Check out [this](https://github.com/mehrankamal/competitive-100/commit/721e83083c320d3a871f54ed681f97fe7c1acd92) commit on the [mehrankamal/competitive-100](https://github.com/mehrankamal/competitive-100) repo.

### R1D5 - August 18, Wednesday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Started with [Cloud Native Go: Building Reliable Services in Unreliable Environments](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-go/9781492076322/) book.

**Thoughts:** Learned about the core componets of a cloud native applications. 9 pages with notes read for the first chapter: "What is Cloud Native?"

**Link to work:** Notes [here](/cloud-native-notes.md)

### R1D6 - August 19, Thursday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Solved 3 graph problems from the CSES problemset.

**Thoughts:** 2 problems involved simple bfs/dfs and some path traversal. The 3rd problem was a bit difficult to approach for me. It contained the bipartiteness check. But was clear once I checked application of bfs/dfs.

**Link to work:** Check out the last 3 problems in the [mehrankamal/competitive-100](https://github.com/mehrankamal/competitive-100) repo, according to commit [here](https://github.com/mehrankamal/competitive-100/commit/501d8b8bbd64a1b629975a27f7ed836ee9acafe0).

### R1D7 -August 20, Friday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finished chapter 1 of the Go book and started with the chapter 2.

**Thoughts:** Learned that why other languages may not be a good fit for a cloud native environment and the way of Go maybe better to approach those problems.

### R1D8 - August 21, Saturday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter 2 and started with Chapter 3 - Cloud Native Go Constructs of Cloud Native Go book.

**Thoughts:** Learned about how Go solves the problems with the previous languages used for cloud native applications.

### R1D9 - August 22, Sunday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Read Chapter 3 till the Pointers topic.

**Thoughts:** The chapter presents a overview of go constructs that how they are different from other languages and what makes Go code idiomatic as compared to other languages.
