### R1D0 - August 13, Friday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** It's day 0. So, I planned the things I am going to be doing next 100 days.

**Thoughts:** I am planning on getting my hands dirty with backend systems and Machine Learning. I will be following the [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) and some other online courses for Machine Learning, and [Go in Practice](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-practice) and other resources for backend part. I will also be brushing up on Data Structures and Algorithms and solving problems on platform such as Codeforces, CodeChef, and CSES pSet.

### R1D1 - August 14, Saturday, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Solved problems [Counting Rooms](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1192) and [Labyrinth](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1193) which were graph problems, easily solvable using BFS and DFS. Started ```Hands-On ML``` book chapter 1 and read till Page 17.

**Thoughts:** I spent 2 hours today. Learned about the of machine learning landscape that we have Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement and Semi learning environments. How the offline and online training can be applicable to some tasks and just the lifecycle of an ML Project. In Competitive Programming, I revised Graph algorithms and solved problems to get going.
